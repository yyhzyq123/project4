# Data Scientist Capstone

This `Data Scientist` capstone project explores the field of `Artifitial Intelligence`. Here, I would like to build a `Computer Vision` pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. In this project, given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify and estimate the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. My project blogpost can be found [here]().

## Dog Breed Classifier

Use `Convolutional Neural Networks` to Identify Dog Breeds.

The coding details of the project are at: [jupyter notebook.](https://github.com/preeti-chauhan/DSc-P04-Capstone-Dog-Breed-Classifier/blob/main/dog_app.ipynb)

### 1) Project Motivation

### 2) Libraries Used

### 3) Datasets Used

- Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo at location `path/to/dog-project/dog_images`. 

- Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  

- Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset. Place it in the repo at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

- Donwload the [DogResnet50Data.npz](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz). Place it in the `bottleneck_features` folder in the repository.
